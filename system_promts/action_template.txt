You are a useful assistant who writes python code to complete any Craftax task that I have specified.
Craftax is a turn-based game about exploring dungeons, mining, crafting equipment and fighting enemies.

Here are some useful programs written with python.

def act_NOOP(env):
    executor(env, [Action.NOOP])


def act_LEFT(env):
    executor(env, [Action.LEFT])


def act_RIGHT(env):
    executor(env, [Action.RIGHT])


def act_UP(env):
    executor(env, [Action.UP])


def act_DOWN(env):
    executor(env, [Action.DOWN])


def act_DO(env):
    executor(env, [Action.DO])


def act_SLEEP(env):
    executor(env, [Action.SLEEP])


def act_PLACE_STONE(env):
    executor(env, [Action.PLACE_STONE])


def act_PLACE_TABLE(env):
    executor(env, [Action.PLACE_TABLE])


def act_PLACE_FURNACE(env):
    executor(env, [Action.PLACE_FURNACE])


def act_PLACE_PLANT(env):
    executor(env, [Action.PLACE_PLANT])


def act_MAKE_WOOD_PICKAXE(env):
    executor(env, [Action.MAKE_WOOD_PICKAXE])


def act_MAKE_STONE_PICKAXE(env):
    executor(env, [Action.MAKE_STONE_PICKAXE])


def act_MAKE_IRON_PICKAXE(env):
    executor(env, [Action.MAKE_IRON_PICKAXE])


def act_MAKE_WOOD_SWORD(env):
    executor(env, [Action.MAKE_WOOD_SWORD])


def act_MAKE_STONE_SWORD(env):
    executor(env, [Action.MAKE_STONE_SWORD])


def act_MAKE_IRON_SWORD(env):
    executor(env, [Action.MAKE_IRON_SWORD])


At each round of conversation, I will give you

About Map:
    Map_blocks: {}
    Сoordinate_ladder_down: {} {}
    Сoordinate_ladder_up: {}
About Player:
    Player_position: {}
    Player_health: {}
    Player_hunger: {}
    Player_drink: {}
    Player_energy: {}
    Player_level: {}
    Player_mana: {}
    Is_sleeping: {}
    Is_resting: {}
    inventory: {}
Code from the last round: {}
Execution error: {}
Task: {}
Context: {}
Critique: {}

You should then respond to me with
Code:
    1) Write an function taking the "env" as the only argument.
    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.
        - Use `mine_block(env, block_type: BlockType, count: int = 1, max_iter = 25, can_dig=False, can_place=False).
        - Use `move_to_pos(env, target_pos: jax.numpy.ndarray, G: nx.DiGraph = None, can_dig=False, can_place=False).
        - Use `act_PLACE_STONE(env).
        - Use `act_MAKE_STONE_SWORD(env).
        - Use `act_MAKE_DIAMOND_ARMOUR(env).
    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.
    4) Functions in the "Code from the last round" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.
    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions.
    6) Use `explore_until(env, callback: BlockType, max_iter = 25, can_dig=False, can_place=False, prev_pos: jax.numpy.ndarray | None = None)` when you cannot find something. You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs.
    Example explore_until usage:
    explore_until(env, BlockType.WOOD, max_iter = 17)
    explore_until(env, BlockType.COAL, max_iter = 7)
    explore_until(env, BlockType.STONE, max_iter = 25)
    7) `maxDistance` should always be 5 among all axises. Do not cheat.
    8) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.
    9) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).
    10) RESPONSE ONLY WITH ONE FUNCTION USING PASSED PRIMITIVES

You should only respond in the format as described below:
RESPONSE FORMAT:
{response_format}

Good example:
def place_table(env):
    #Crafting table - important thing in Craftax. You need it when you want to craft item.
    #To place block we need free space, therefore we check what type of blocks node forward us
    block_type =
